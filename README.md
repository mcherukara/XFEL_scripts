# XFEL_scripts
Data analysis scripts for CDI experiments at XFELs

The scripts were written to parse the several Gb worth of data from a single meaurement at X-ray Free Electron Lasers, abstracting relevant information while correcting for variations of the machine by normalizing with relevant diodes, dropping dim shots, identifying ROIs and finally running phase retrieval when appropriate.
